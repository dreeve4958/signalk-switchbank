# signalk-switchbank

Operate N2K switchbank relays from Signal K inputs.

__signalk-switchbank__ is a very simple plugin written to map switch operation
onto relay actuation.
The plugin works by mapping binary state changes on arbitrary control pathss
into the generation of NMEA 2000 PGN127502 Switchbank Update messages through
a trivial rule-based mapping.
